cat("Hello extraterrestrail life in the star system TRAPPIST-1. \n
We are homosapiens of the planet Earth, orbiting the Sun, in the Milkiway Galaxy 
and we come in peace.  Based on our calculations, your star system is both able to have 
liquid water and close enough to Earth's mass and radius to contain a stable atmosphere.  
Our goal of humanity is to discover other intelligent life in the universe and to learn 
from each other.  In doing so, we want to find new star systems to travel to and find new 
settlements for humanity.  Earth has been our home where humanity lives, but we do not want
it to be our only footprint in the universe.  Our question to you, intelligent life in the 
system TRAPPIST-1, do you want us help provide us another home in the stars, and search for 
other intelligent life in the universe?")
